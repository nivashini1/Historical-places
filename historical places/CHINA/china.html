          The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built
          across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and
          Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the
          Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th
          century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi
          Huang, the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.
          Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple
          stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were
          built by the Ming dynasty. Apart from defense, other purposes of the
          Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of
          duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or
          encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.
          Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were
          enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison
          stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire,
          and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a
          transportation corridor. The frontier walls built by different
          dynasties have multiple courses.

          The Summer Palace is a vast ensemble of lakes, gardens and palaces in
          Beijing. It was an imperial garden in the Qing dynasty. Inside
          includes Longevity Hill Kunming Lake and Seventeen Hole Bridge. It
          covers an expanse of 2.9 square kilometres, three-quarters of which is
          water. Longevity Hill is about 60 metres high and has many buildings
          positioned in sequence. The front hill is rich with splendid halls and
          pavilions, while the back hill, in sharp contrast, is quiet with
          natural beauty. The central Kunming Lake, covering 2.2 square
          kilometres, was entirely man-made and the excavated soil was used to
          build Longevity Hill. Inspired by the gardens in South China, in the
          Summer Palace there are over 3,000 various Chinese ancient buildings
          that house a collection of over 40,000 kinds of valuable historical
          relics from each dynasty. In December 1998, UNESCO included the Summer
          Palace on its World Heritage List. It declared the Summer Palace "a
          masterpiece of Chinese landscape garden design.

          Tiananmen Square or Tian'anmen Square is a city square in the city
          center of Beijing, China, named after the eponymous Tiananmen located
          to its north, which separates it from the Forbidden City. The square
          contains the Monument to the People's Heroes, the Great Hall of the
          People, the National Museum of China, and the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong.
          Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China
          in the square on October 1, 1949; the anniversary of this event is
          still observed there. The size of Tiananmen Square is 765 x 282
          meters. It has great cultural significance as it was the site of
          several important events in Chinese history. Outside China, the square
          is best known for the 1989 protests and massacre that ended with a
          military crackdown, which is also known as the Tiananmen Square
          Massacre or the June Fourth Massacre.

          The Temple of Heaven is an imperial complex of religious buildings
          situated in the southeastern part of central Beijing. The complex was
          visited by the Emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties for annual
          ceremonies of prayer to Heaven for a good harvest. The Temple of
          Heaven was inscribed as a World Heritage site in 1998 and was
          described as "a masterpiece of architecture and landscape design which
          simply and graphically illustrates a cosmogony of great importance for
          the evolution of one of the world's great civilizations..." as the
          "symbolic layout and design of the Temple of Heaven had a profound
          influence on architecture and planning in the Far East over many
          centuries."
