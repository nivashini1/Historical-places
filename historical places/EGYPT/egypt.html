          Abu Simbel is a historic site comprising two massive rock-cut temples
          in the village of Abu Simbel, Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt, near the
          border with Sudan. It is situated on the western bank of Lake Nasser,
          about 230 km southwest of Aswan. The complex is part of the UNESCO
          World Heritage Site known as the "Nubian Monuments", which run from
          Abu Simbel downriver to Philae, and include Amada, Wadi es-Sebua, and
          other Nubian sites. The twin temples were originally carved out of the
          mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the 19th Dynasty reign of
          the Pharaoh Ramesses II. They serve as a lasting monument to the king
          Ramesses II. His wife Nefertari and children can be seen in smaller
          figures by his feet, considered to be of lesser importance and were
          not given the same position of scale. This commemorates his victory at
          the Battle of Kadesh. Their huge external rock relief figures have
          become iconic.

          The Valley of the Kings, also known as the Valley of the Gates of the
          Kings, is a valley in Egypt where, for a period of nearly 500 years
          from the 16th to 11th century BC, rock-cut tombs were excavated for
          the pharaohs and powerful nobles of the New Kingdom. The valley stands
          on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes, within the heart of the
          Theban Necropolis. The wadi consists of two valleys: the East Valley
          and the West Valley. With the 2005 discovery of a new chamber and the
          2008 discovery of two further tomb entrances, the valley is known to
          contain 63 tombs and chambers. It was the principal burial place of
          the major royal figures of the Egyptian New Kingdom, as well as a
          number of privileged nobles. The royal tombs are decorated with scenes
          from Egyptian mythology and give clues as to the beliefs and funerary
          practices of the period. Almost all of the tombs seem to have been
          opened and robbed in antiquity, but they still give an idea of the
          opulence and power of the pharaohs. This area has been a focus of
          archaeological and Egyptological exploration since the end of the
          eighteenth century, and its tombs and burials continue to stimulate
          research and interest.

          The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak, comprises a vast
          mix of decayed temples, pylons, chapels, and other buildings near
          Luxor, Egypt. Construction at the complex began during the reign of
          Senusret I in the Middle Kingdom and continued into the Ptolemaic
          Kingdom, although most of the extant buildings date from the New
          Kingdom. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian Ipet-isut and
          the main place of worship of the 18th Dynastic Theban Triad, with the
          god Amun as its head. It is part of the monumental city of Thebes, and
          in 1979 it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List along with
          the rest of the city. The Karnak complex gives its name to the nearby,
          and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, 2.5 kilometres
          north of Luxor.

          The Great Sphinx of Giza is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx,
          a mythical creature with the head of a human, and the body of a lion.
          Facing directly from west to east, it stands on the Giza Plateau on
          the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The face of the Sphinx
          appears to represent the pharaoh Khafre. The original shape of the
          Sphinx was cut from the bedrock, and has since been restored with
          layers of limestone blocks. It measures 73 m long from paw to tail, 20
          m high from the base to the top of the head and 19 m wide at its rear
          haunches. Its nose was broken off for unknown reasons between the 3rd
          and 10th centuries AD. The Sphinx is the oldest known monumental
          sculpture in Egypt and one of the most recognisable statues in the
          world. The archaeological evidence suggests that it was created by
          ancient Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the reign of Khafre.

          Khan el-Khalili is a famous bazaar and souq in the historic center of
          Cairo, Egypt. Established as a center of trade in the Mamluk era and
          named for one of its several historic caravanserais, the bazaar
          district has since become one of Cairo's main attractions for tourists
          and Egyptians alike. It is also home to many Egyptian artisans and
          workshops involved in the production of traditional crafts and
          souvenirs. The name Khan el-Khalili historically referred to a single
          building in the area; today it refers to the entire shopping district.
