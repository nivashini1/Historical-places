          The Shwedagon Pagoda; Mon: ကျာ်ဒဂုၚ်; officially named Shwedagon Zedi
          Daw and also known as the Great Dagon Pagoda and the Golden Pagoda is
          a gilded stupa located in Yangon, Myanmar. The Shwedagon is the most
          sacred Buddhist pagoda in Myanmar, as it is believed to contain relics
          of the four previous Buddhas of the present kalpa. These relics
          include the staff of Kakusandha, the water filter of Koṇāgamana, a
          piece of the robe of Kassapa, and eight strands of hair from the head
          of Gautama. Built on the 51-metre high Singuttara Hill, the 112 m tall
          pagoda stands 170 m above sea level, and dominates the Yangon skyline.
          Yangon's zoning regulations, which cap the maximum height of buildings
          to 127 metres above sea level, ensure the Shwedagon's prominence in
          the city's skyline.

          Inle Lake, a freshwater lake located in the Nyaungshwe Township of
          Shan State, part of Shan Hills in Myanmar. It is the second largest
          lake in Myanmar with an estimated surface area of 44.9 square miles,
          and one of the highest at an elevation of 2,900 feet. During the dry
          season, the average water depth is 7 feet, with the deepest point
          being 12 feet. During the rainy season, this can increase by 5 feet.
          The watershed area for the lake lies to a large extent to the north
          and west of the lake. The lake drains through the Nam Pilu or Balu
          Chaung on its southern end. There is also a hot spring on its
          northwestern shore. Large sections of the lake are covered by floating
          plants. Its clear and slightly alkaline waters are home to a diverse
          fauna and many species found nowhere else in the world. There are more
          than 35 native species of fish, including 17 endemics. Some of these,
          notably the Sawbwa barb, red dwarf rasbora, emerald dwarf rasbora,
          Lake Inle danio, Inle loach and the Inle snakehead, are of minor
          commercial importance for the aquarium trade. Several fish that are
          not native have been introduced

          The Ananda Temple, located in Bagan, Myanmar is a Buddhist temple
          built in 1105 AD during the reign of King Kyansittha of the Pagan
          Dynasty. The temple layout is in a cruciform with several terraces
          leading to a small pagoda at the top covered by an umbrella known as
          hti, which is the name of the umbrella or top ornament found in almost
          all pagodas in Myanmar. The Buddhist temple houses four standing
          Buddhas, each one facing the cardinal direction of East, North, West
          and South. The temple is said to be an architectural wonder in a
          fusion of Mon and adopted Indian style of architecture. The impressive
          temple has also been titled the "Westminster Abbey of Burma". The
          temple has close similarity to the Pathothamya temple of the 10th–11th
          century, and is also known as “veritable museum of stones”. The temple
          was damaged in the earthquake of 1975. However, it has been fully
          restored and is well maintained by frequent painting and whitewashing
          of the walls. On the occasion of 900th anniversary of its construction
          celebrated in 1990 the temple spires were gilded. It is a highly
          revered temple of Bagan.

          U Bein Bridge is a crossing that spans the Taungthaman Lake near
          Amarapura in Myanmar. The 1.2-kilometre bridge was built around 1850
          and is believed to be the oldest and longest teakwood bridge in the
          world. Construction began when the capital of Ava Kingdom moved to
          Amarapura, and the bridge is named after Maung Bein who had it built.
          It is used as an important passageway for the local people and has
          also become a tourist attraction and therefore a significant source of
          income for souvenir sellers. It is particularly busy during July and
          August when the lake is at its highest. The bridge was built from wood
          reclaimed from the former royal palace in Inwa. It features 1,086
          pillars that stretch out of the water, some of which have been
          replaced with concrete. Though the bridge largely remains intact,
          there are fears that an increasing number of the pillars are becoming
          dangerously decayed. Some have become entirely detached from their
          bases and only remain in place because of the lateral bars holding
          them together. Damage to these supports have been caused by flooding
          as well as a fish breeding program introduced into the lake which has
          caused the water to become stagnant.

          The Sule Pagoda is a Burmese stupa located in the heart of downtown
          Yangon, occupying the centre of the city and an important space in
          contemporary Burmese politics, ideology and geography. According to
          legend, it was built before the Shwedagon Pagoda during the time of
          the Buddha, making it more than 2,600 years old. Burmese legend states
          that the site for the Shwedagon Pagoda was asked to be revealed from
          an old nat who resided at the place where the Sule Pagoda now stands.
          The Sule Pagoda has been the focal point of both Yangon and Burmese
          politics. It has served as a rallying point in the 1988 uprisings,
          2007 Saffron Revolution and 2021 Spring Revolution. The pagoda is
          listed on the Yangon City Heritage List.
