          Petra, originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a
          historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. It is adjacent to
          the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains
          forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead
          Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has been inhabited
          from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in
          what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the
          4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of
          Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time
          Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who
          invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by
          establishing it as a major regional trading hub. The trading business
          gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus
          of their wealth. The Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the
          barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were able to repel attacks
          by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were
          particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone
          carving.

          The treasury Al-Khazneh is one of the most elaborate temples in Petra,
          a city of the Nabatean Kingdom inhabited by the Arabs in ancient
          times. As with most of the other buildings in this ancient town,
          including the Monastery, this structure was carved out of a sandstone
          rock face. The structure is believed to have been the mausoleum of the
          Nabatean King Aretas IV in the 1st century AD. It is one of the most
          popular tourist attractions in both Jordan and the region. It became
          known as "Al-Khazneh", or The Treasury, in the early 19th century by
          the area's Bedouins as they had believed it contained treasures.

          Amman's Roman Theatre is a 6,000-seat, 2nd-century Roman theatre. A
          famous landmark in the Jordanian capital, it dates back to the Roman
          period when the city was known as Philadelphia. The theatre and the
          nearby Odeon are flanking the new Hashemite Plaza from the south and
          the east respectively, while the Roman Nymphaeum is just a short
          stroll away in north-westerly direction.

          The Amman Citadel is an archeological site at the center of downtown
          Amman, the capital of Jordan. The L-shaped hill is one of the seven
          hills that originally made up Amman. The Citadel has a long history of
          occupation by many great civilizations. Evidence of inhabitance since
          the Neolithic period has been found and the hill was fortified during
          the Bronze Age. The hill became the capital of the Kingdom of Ammon
          sometime after 1200 BCE. It later came under the sway of empires such
          as the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Neo-Babylonian Empire, the Ptolemies, the
          Seleucids, Romans, Byzantines and the Umayyads. After the Umayyads,
          came a period of decline and for much of the time until 1878 as the
          former city became an abandoned pile of ruins only sporadically used
          by Bedouins and seasonal farmers. Despite this gap, the Citadel of
          Amman is considered to be among the world's oldest continuously
          inhabited places. Most of the structures still visible at the site are
          from the Roman, Byzantine, and Umayyad periods. The major remains at
          the site are the Temple of Hercules, a Byzantine church, and the
          Umayyad Palace. The Jordan Archaeological Museum was built on the hill
          in 1951.

          The monastery Ad Deir, also spelled ad-Dayr and el-Deir, is a
          monumental building carved out of rock in the ancient Jordanian city
          of Petra. The Deir was probably carved out of the rock in the
          mid-first century CE. Arguably one of the most iconic monuments in the
          Petra Archaeological Park, the Monastery is located high in the hills
          northwest of the Petra city center. It is the second most commonly
          visited monument in Petra, after the Khazneh or "Treasury". The huge
          facade, the inner chamber and the other structures next to it or in
          the wider area around the Deir probably originally served a complex
          religious purpose, and was possibly repurposed as a church in the
          Byzantine period.
