          Borobudur, also transcribed Barabudur is a 9th-century Mahayana
          Buddhist temple in Magelang Regency, not far from the town of
          Muntilan, in Central Java, Indonesia. It is the world's largest
          Buddhist temple. The temple consists of nine stacked platforms, six
          square and three circular, topped by a central dome. It is decorated
          with 2,672 relief panels and originally 504 Buddha statues. The
          central dome is surrounded by 72 Buddha statues, each seated inside a
          perforated stupa. Built in the 9th century during the reign of the
          Sailendra Dynasty, the temple design follows Javanese Buddhist
          architecture, which blends the Indonesian indigenous tradition of
          ancestor worship and the Buddhist concept of attaining nirvāṇa. The
          temple demonstrates the influences of Gupta art that reflects India's
          influence on the region, yet there are enough indigenous scenes and
          elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian. The
          monument is a shrine to the Buddha and a place for Buddhist
          pilgrimage.
